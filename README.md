<b>Evaluating Morphological Computation in Muscle and DC-motor Driven Models of Human Hopping</b>, by <i> Keyan Ghazi-Zahedi, Daniel F.B. Haeufle, Guido Montufar, Syn Schmitt, and Nihat Ay,</i> Front. Robot. AI, 2016, [PDF](http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/frobt.2016.00042/full)


The file examples/hopping/mc.cpp contains the calculations that lead to the results discussed in the paper above. 

The files and data used in that publication can also be found in the directory <b> matlab</b>. Running the script <b> analyse_hopping_data </b> will produce the results found in the publication.
