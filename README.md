# Entropy++
C++ Implementation of entropy measures

Sparse matrix implementations are available.

More information will follow soon.


## Morphological computation

MC_W and MC_MI are available and more information about these measures can be found in

<b>Evaluating Morphological Computation in Muscle and DC-motor Driven Models of Human Hopping</b>, by <i> Keyan Ghazi-Zahedi, Daniel F.B. Haeufle, Guido Montufar, Syn Schmitt, and Nihat Ay,</i> [Arxiv 1512.00250](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.00250)

The file examples/hopping/mc.cpp contains the calculations that lead to the results discussed in the paper above. A MATLAB implementation can be found at [https://github.com/kzahedi/MC.](https://github.com/kzahedi/MC)
